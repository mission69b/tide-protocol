# Legal & Risk Disclosure — Tide Core v1 (FEF)

**Status:** Canonical  
**Scope:** Applies to Tide Core v1 and its first product surface, FEF (Faith Expansion Fund)

This section defines the legal positioning, risk disclosures, and explicit non-claims of the Tide Core v1 protocol.  
It is intended to ensure consistency across code, documentation, UI, and communications.

---

## 1. No Offering of Securities or Financial Instruments

Tide Core v1 **does not constitute** and **must not be represented as**:

- a securities offering
- an equity offering
- a token sale
- a loan or debt instrument
- a collective investment scheme
- an investment contract
- a crowdfunding or fundraising campaign
- a promise of profit or return

Participation involves interacting with non-custodial smart contracts governed exclusively by deterministic on-chain logic.

---

## 2. No Investment Advice or Recommendations

Nothing in Tide Core v1, FEF, associated documentation, dashboards, or UI:

- constitutes investment advice
- constitutes financial advice
- constitutes legal or tax advice
- recommends participation or contribution
- makes suitability determinations

All users are responsible for their own decisions and for understanding applicable laws in their jurisdiction.

---

## 3. Capital Contributions & Finality

### 3.1 Pre-Finalization Deposits

Contributions made **before a listing is finalized** are treated as **escrowed deposits**.

If a listing:
- is cancelled, or
- fails to reach finalization,

then such deposits are automatically returned, as they **never entered the capital formation phase**.

This technical unwind:
- does not constitute a refund of capital
- does not create any ongoing right of withdrawal
- does not apply after listing finalization

### 3.2 Post-Finalization Finality

Once a listing is finalized:

- all contributions are **irreversible**
- no refunds, withdrawals, or redemptions exist
- capital is released only according to the deterministic release schedule

---

## 4. No Guaranteed Yield or Returns

Rewards distributed via Tide Core v1 and FEF:

- are **variable**
- are **non-guaranteed**
- are **usage-derived**
- may be zero

Rewards MUST NOT be described as:

- dividends
- guaranteed yield
- profit sharing
- fixed returns
- ROI guarantees
- interest payments

Any rate metrics displayed (e.g. historical or implied rates):

- are derived exclusively from past on-chain data
- are non-predictive
- do not imply future performance

---

## 5. Native Sui Staking Risk Disclosure

While capital is timelocked, Tide Core v1 may stake SUI via **native Sui staking only**.

Native staking involves risks including, but not limited to:

- validator underperformance
- slashing or protocol penalties
- delayed unstaking or withdrawal
- protocol-level changes to staking mechanics

Tide Core v1:
- does not rehypothecate capital
- does not lend capital
- does not engage in third-party DeFi strategies

However, **staking risk remains** and must be disclosed.

---

## 6. No Revenue or Performance Guarantees

Protocol revenue routed into RewardVaults:

- depends entirely on real protocol usage
- may fluctuate or cease entirely
- is not guaranteed to exist at any time

Capital release schedules:
- are **not contingent on revenue**
- are **not paused due to low or zero revenue**
- are governed solely by deterministic time-based rules

---

## 7. Non-Economic Identity & Reputation

Any identity, reputation, badge, epoch, or recognition system:

- is **purely expressive**
- confers **no financial advantage**
- does not alter rewards, yields, or capital flows
- provides no governance power or voting rights

Reputation metrics are:
- read-only
- non-transferable
- informational only

---

## 8. Transparency Without Discretion

Dashboards, metrics, and analytics:

- are derived entirely from on-chain data
- involve no discretionary reporting
- do not alter protocol behavior
- do not constitute disclosures or promises

Off-chain presentation does not affect on-chain rules.

---

## 9. Jurisdictional Responsibility

Users are solely responsible for:

- determining whether participation is lawful in their jurisdiction
- complying with local laws, regulations, and reporting obligations
- understanding tax implications

Tide Core v1 does not restrict participation by jurisdiction and does not perform compliance checks.

---

## 10. Prevailing Rule

In the event of any inconsistency between:

- UI
- documentation
- marketing materials
- third-party descriptions

**The on-chain smart contract logic prevails.**

---

## TL;DR (Non-Normative)

Tide Core v1 is infrastructure — not an investment product.

No promises.  
No guarantees.  
No discretion.  
Code only.
